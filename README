Just a whole load of random code I've done in the past.
Alot of it is trival but there is also some interesting generation stuff
Most of this will not be updated unless bugs need to be fixed
This code is taken from my project folders and compiled into one file, I will not give instructions on how to compile the code
since most will just need a quick reference.

All code is under GPL unless otherwise stated.
If there's any interest to put it under anything more flexable then I will move it into MIT.
